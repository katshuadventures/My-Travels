        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Katherine Shu. I'm from the LA area and I'm currently studying EECS in school. My family has always seen traveling as a must so since I was little, I have been exploring the world. Stretching from Asia to Europe to Africa, the places that I have traveled to have never ceased to amaze me. All the different styles of living, all the different cultures, and all the different activities have made me fall in love with traveling. Now, traveling is one of my favorite hobbies. I created this website both as a way to share and to document my travels so that I'll never forget what I have seen and experienced. I hope you enjoy the variety of information, ranging from food recommendations to funny moments that I witnessed on my adventures!</p>
