        <div class="title">Europe & Taiwan</div>
        <div class="time">2018 SUMMER</div>
        <div class="description">I flew a complete circle around the world. I started by flying to Europe, then to Taiwan, then back to LA. In Europe, I visited multiple iconic cities, including Barcelona, Lisbon, Paris, Milan, and London. Every city had their own unique flair. For Lisbon, it was the cable cars that ran through the hilly city. For Barcelona, it was the extensive old town, filled with a variety of fun shops and restaurants. To top it all off, after a month in Europe, I got to visit Taiwan and eat all of my favorite foods. This trip is surely one of the most memorable because I was able to check "flying around the world" off my bucket list and because it is the longest vacation that I have ever been on.</div>

        <div class="title">NYC Senior Trip</div>
        <div class="time">2018 SPRING</div>
        <div class="description">As an early senior trip, two of my best friends and I spent a week in New York during our spring break. This was the first time I traveled without my family so things felt different. All in all, I am so grateful for this experience because we got to explore all the wonders of New York City. We poked the Statue of Liberty from afar, ate at the most delicious restaurants, and even visited the Mood store from Project Runway. From this trip, we made so many memories, stretching from my friend accidentally sleeping on the floor to going bright and early to Cookie Do only to find out that they are closed on Mondays. All of these memories are engrained in my mind and I can't wait to travel with my two friends again!</div>

        <div class="title">Vietnam & Taiwan</div>
        <div class="time">2018 WINTER</div>
        <div class="description">Before starting our tour, my mom and I visited Sapa, a small town hidden in the mountains. There, we got to explore traditional villages. After that, we went on the classic Vietnam tour that took us from Hanoi in the North, all the way down to Ho Chi Minh City in the South. On this trip, I learned so much about Vietnam's history and how much the North & South differed. It was very interesting to learn about how the rice fields functioned, which war tactics were used, and much more. We also stopped by Taiwan after the tour to visit relatives. </div>

        <div class="title">Peru & Chile</div>
        <div class="time">2017 Summer</div>
        <div class="description">This was my first time visiting South America and I was very ready to practice my Spanish. In Peru, I learned so much about their culture. My favorite place in Peru is Lake Titicaca because it just amazed me how the natives can live on islands made of grass. Lake Titicaca just differed immensely from where I live, making me more intrigued in the area. Next, I ventured to Chile. In Chile, I only visited Santiago and Easter Island. Easter Island was my favorite because I was able to see the Moai Statues that I always saw in pictures. Best of all, the island's population was small so there was a relaxing and carefree atmosphere that made the visit very enjoyable. Best of all, cute llamas and alpacas filled the entire trip.</div>

        <div class="title">Bali & Taiwan</div>
        <div class="time">2017 WINTER</div>
        <div class="description">Bali island in Indonesia is the true example of relaxtion. With my sister and mom, I got to explore Bali. My favorite experience in Bali was walking through the Monkey Forrest. Honestly, it was scary at first with all the monkeys jumping around but it was definitely a unique and unforgettable experience. The monkeys would jump on you an one even put his hand over my eyes. We also stopped in Taiwan afterwards for our usual food and fun there.</div>

        <div class="title">Australia, Korea, & Taiwan</div>
        <div class="time">2016 SUMMER</div>
        <div class="description">This trip is extremely memorable because it's the first time that I visited the Southern hemisphere. My favorite part of Australia was probably all the different animals. I got to pet and feed koalas and kangaroos. I also had the opportunity to meet so many new animals that I didn't know existed, including wombats. Another favorite of mine in Australia was watching an opera in the Sydney Opera House because the Opera House is somewhere that always shows up in pictures and I never thought I would actually be inside it. Plus, the opera was amazing too. Afterwards, I visited Korea with my grandpa and mom. Then, we all went back to Taiwan for a little.</div>
