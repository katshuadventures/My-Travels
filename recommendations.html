        <h2>How to Get the Best Koala Picture (Australia)</h2>
        <p>There's some places where you can physically carry a koala, but the best picture and the best experience is petting a sleeping koala at the Australian Reptile Park in Somersby Australia. This is the only way to capture the utter cuteness of a koala. Koalas sleep for about twenty hours per day and when they sleep, they curl themselves up into a ball on the tree. Therefore, the best picture angle is to stand behind the koala, lean your head in, and then take a selfie with the koala. In general, the Australian Reptile Park is a fun visit. There, you can also feed kangaroos as the jump around you in an open area! If you visit the park, I recommend doing so in the morning, when there is hardly any people (so that others don't get in your photos) and when it's still cool. </p>

        <h2>Cat Cat Village (Vietnam)</h2>
        <p>In order to experience the complete culture of Vietnam, a must is visiting Sapa, where the Cat Cat Village and some other tribe's villages are located. In these villages, you'll see how the natives live. As you stroll through the village, you'll admire the unique architecture of the village being built on the side of a mountain, get your exercise in, and indulge in some handicrafts along the way. The scenary there is absolutely beautiful and unforgettable, making it perfect for pictures. There are even small shacks (as you can kind of see in the back left of my photo), that are perfect places to rest and soak in the scenary, all along the trail. Staying in Sapa makes it easy to visit these villages since they're only a short taxi ride away. This short ride is very important because then you can quickly get back to your hotel in take a refreshing shower after visiting these villages because you'll surely be all sweaty and sticky due to the humidity and hot temperatures in Vietnam.</p>
